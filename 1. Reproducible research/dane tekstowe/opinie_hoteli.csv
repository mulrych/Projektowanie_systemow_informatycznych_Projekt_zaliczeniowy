1,"Really excellent trip, covered so many highlights of Egypt. The itinerary was really good, some long days but we got to see so much. Perhaps a little extra time in Hurghada to relax and appreciate the seaside would have been nice. But overall would 100% recommend, was a childhood dream come true to see all the ancient sites with my own eyes. Our tour guide *Personal information removed by Feefo* was excellent and knew all the history and the best spots for photos. We also managed to beat the crowds in most stops which really helped. The Nile cruise was a highlight, the boat was really excellent! Even the train ride wasn’t too bad and a travel experience to remember! This trip was the perfect way to see the best of Egypt!"
2,"The trip was amazing! Loved from start to finish, was very sad when it came to an end, however, made many friends and memories I’ll never forget. Our Trip manager *Personal information removed by Feefo* was incredible, he went above and beyond for everyone and made the experience all that much more enjoyable. And our bus driver *Personal information removed by Feefo* was also amazing going above and beyond. Would 100% recommend everyone to contiki and this trip."
3,"This trip was absolutely amazing! If you’re going to do a tour around Europe this is the one to do as you cover as much ground as possible. The free time add ons and included walking tours were next level! We had a lot of time to do our own things and time to rest at stops so it didn’t feel constantly fast paced which was good.  The hostels and hotels were great and clean, some were small at times but that was all. Our tour manager and coach driver were also so amazing! They were so friendly, funny and approachable – thanks *Personal information removed by Feefo* and *Personal information removed by Feefo* for everything!! I highly recommend this tour to anyone :)"
4,"This trip is actually part of the LA to Miami tour so when you start in Dallas the rest might already be traveling for two weeks. The trip is a very cool route in the south, lots of music and history of that is your thing. It can be a party trip depending on the people in the group. Overall great fun and some good free time add ons. Some hotels were not so great and kinda filthy."
5,"Trip was easy to book, the website allowed you to pre book accommodation at the right hotel beforehand. Making it 10x easier instead of booking multiple hotels."
6,"Absolutely loved meeting new people! Seeing a different country and their culture :). Absolutely loved having a contiki chit chat group on what’s app that allowed everyone on tour to message in it to find out what others are doing and hang out. 100% would do it again and do different islands, I guess what they say is right once you start travelling you then get the travel bug!! I am now planning 2 more trips already :)"
7,"So some of the adds on descriptions were very misleading. It was really frustrating to arrive at the trip to discover that Jung Frau was not included in the trip, but was extra for a day trip. And that I also had to pay for a canyon swing that I did not want to do."
8,"*Personal information removed by Feefo* did a good job getting to know everyone in the group and trying to keep track of the team. Some things he could work on: communication on what the itinerary for each day was. He did good for Austria but Switzerland wasn't clear. It would also be helpful if he gathered everyone to provide information and got our attention prior to tell us facts because most didn't notice until part way through. Questions got re asked repeatedly. Also it would have been nice to have more facts and knowledge about the country and where we were going."
9,"This trip was beyond anything I could have imagined from the amazing adventures - surfing, canyoning, zip lining, hanging bridges to the beautiful sights and people of Costa Rica. Contiki and our tour manager *Personal information removed by Feefo* did an amazing job of planning very was so smooth and I loved the balance between rainforest and beach days. Our group was amazing we are already planning our Reunion trip!!!"
10,"It was a quick trip that showcased a lot of what Europe has to offer! I would recommend possibly doing this trip in early winter or early spring to get more snow. That being said, a trip during spring was very pleasant too! Shout out to the team (*Personal information removed by Feefo* and *Personal information removed by Feefo*) for being superstars for getting us to places safely and being awesome guides."
