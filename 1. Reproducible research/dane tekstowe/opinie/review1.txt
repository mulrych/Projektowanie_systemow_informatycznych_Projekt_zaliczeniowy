Really excellent trip, covered so many highlights of Egypt. The itinerary was really good, some long days but we got to see so much. Perhaps a little extra time in Hurghada to relax and appreciate the seaside would have been nice. But overall would 100% recommend, was a childhood dream come true to see all the ancient sites with my own eyes. Our tour guide *Personal information removed by Feefo* was excellent and knew all the history and the best spots for photos. We also managed to beat the crowds in most stops which really helped. The Nile cruise was a highlight, the boat was really excellent! Even the train ride wasnâ€™t too bad and a travel experience to remember! This trip was the perfect way to see the best of Egypt!
