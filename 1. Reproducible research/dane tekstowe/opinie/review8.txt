This trip was beyond anything I could have imagined from the amazing adventures - surfing, canyoning, zip lining, hanging bridges to the beautiful sights and people of Costa Rica. Contiki and our tour manager *Personal information removed by Feefo* did an amazing job of planning very was so smooth and I loved the balance between rainforest and beach days. Our group was amazing we are already planning our Reunion trip!!!
