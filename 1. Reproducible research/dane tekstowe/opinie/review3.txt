This trip is actually part of the LA to Miami tour so when you start in Dallas the rest might already be traveling for two weeks. The trip is a very cool route in the south, lots of music and history of that is your thing. It can be a party trip depending on the people in the group. Overall great fun and some good free time add ons. Some hotels were not so great and kinda filthy.
