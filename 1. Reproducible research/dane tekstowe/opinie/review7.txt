*Personal information removed by Feefo* did a good job getting to know everyone in the group and trying to keep track of the team. Some things he could work on: communication on what the itinerary for each day was. He did good for Austria but Switzerland wasn't clear. It would also be helpful if he gathered everyone to provide information and got our attention prior to tell us facts because most didn't notice until part way through. Questions got re asked repeatedly. Also it would have been nice to have more facts and knowledge about the country and where we were going.
