This trip was absolutely amazing! If you’re going to do a tour around Europe this is the one to do as you cover as much ground as possible. The free time add ons and included walking tours were next level! We had a lot of time to do our own things and time to rest at stops so it didn’t feel constantly fast paced which was good. 
The hostels and hotels were great and clean, some were small at times but that was all. Our tour manager and coach driver were also so amazing! They were so friendly, funny and approachable – thanks *Personal information removed by Feefo* and *Personal information removed by Feefo* for everything!! I highly recommend this tour to anyone :)
