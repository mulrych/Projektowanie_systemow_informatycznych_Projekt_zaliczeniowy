The trip was amazing! Loved from start to finish, was very sad when it came to an end, however, made many friends and memories Iâ€™ll never forget. Our Trip manager *Personal information removed by Feefo* was incredible, he went above and beyond for everyone and made the experience all that much more enjoyable. And our bus driver *Personal information removed by Feefo* was also amazing going above and beyond. Would 100% recommend everyone to contiki and this trip.
